# GPRCPP: Gaussian Processes with R and C++ via Rcpp and RcppArmadillo

In this directory you can find C++ implementations from scratch of the most common covariance functions for modeling with Gaussian Process priors and Gaussian or non-Gaussian likelihoods.
These functions include the Squared-Exponential, the Periodic, and the Linear kernels.

The implementation uses Rcpp and RcppArmadillo and can be used in a general R script.
This is particularly handy since it allows to use the optimization routines that come with R, as well as the more convenient visualization, etc.
The speed improvement offered by these functions in C++ is of roughly two orders of magnitude compared to the R equivalents.
More complex combinations of these simple kernels can be structured in R directly (e.g. the Automatic Relevance Kernel via multiplication of SEs).

For an introduction to these kernels, see:
